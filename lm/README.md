# Kabyle texts for Language Model

This directory contains texts intended to generate a language model with the [KenLM](https://github.com/kpu/kenlm) tool for the Kabyle language.

All content is in the public domain or is donated.

The text submitted here meets the following criteria:
- Everything is in lowercase;
- Punctuation characters are omitted;
- The special characters allowed are ẓ, ṛ, ṭ, ɛ, ṣ, ḍ, ǧ, ḥ, ɣ, č;

The dash "-" which is part of the Kabyle alphabet is also omitted from the text for better prediction of the language model. It will later be regenerated using a [reconstructive model](https://github.com/MestafaKamal/kab-asr-post-processing).

## To contribute
To contribute, all you have to do is add free text or donation content that meets the criteria mentioned above.
